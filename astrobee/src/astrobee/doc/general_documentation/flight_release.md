\page release Creating a Flight Release

This page describes the steps required to complete a flight release. It assumes
that your environment is configured to cross-compile the fsw for the `armhf`
architecture.

## Create a Release Branch

Release branches will be created on a user's fork. To make a release branch,
checkout and update develop. Then make a release branch off of develop. Please
name the branch release-0.x.x.


Please note that creating a release branch and specifying a version number
indicates that the code on the branch is frozen with respect to further
feature changes. However, as you identify bugs during lab testing before
deployment to the ISS, you can still apply bug fixes on that release branch
without incrementing the version number. Of course, that means that as you
iterate, you might end up generating multiple debs with the same version number.
For configuration management purposes, when checking whether two deployments
used identical debs, you should always compare their git commit hashes rather
than their version numbers.

## Update the Release Version

The release version must be updated before creating the Debian. Please use
the update release script to do this. Before running the script, get a list of
features that have been added since the last release. This list will need to be
added to the change log that gets edited when the script is run. Also, in the
change log, change UNRELEASED to testing and change the email address to the
astrobee fsw email address as in previous log entries.

    ./scripts/setup/debians/update_release.sh 0.x.x


*Note: Make sure that your EDITOR variable is set to your preferred editor
before invoking this script. Using vim seems to generate an unimportant error.*

## Commit and Push Version Change

Please make sure to commit and push all the files that were changed.


## Create the Debians

Your environment needs to be configured properly to cross-compile Astrobee
Robot Software for the `armf` architecture. See
[NASA Install documentation](NASA_INSTALL.md).

    ./scripts/build/build_debian.sh


## Testing the Release

On confluence, there is a [release testing procedure](https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/confluence/display/FFFSW/IRG-FFTEST302+-+Astrobee+Release+Testing).
This procedure will walk you through all the testing that needs to be done to
make sure the debian is flight ready. Please create a copy of the procedure by
clicking on the ellipsis at the top right corner of the page and selecting copy.
In the popup, in the 'Parent page' text box, please enter 'Executed Procedures'
and click 'Copy'. Remove 'Copy of' from the title and add the version and date
after the test number such that it looks like
'IRG-FFTEST302 - 0.x.x -YYYY-MM-DD - Astrobee Release Testing'. Be sure to fill
out the 'As-Ran Summary' table and the 'Result' and 'Notes' column for every
step. After running through the procedure, please provide a brief summary of
your results in the
[release testing results table](https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/confluence/display/FFFSW/Release+Testing+Results).

## Fix Bugs

If there are bugs that arise during testing, please fix the bugs, push the
fixes, recreate the debians, and repeat the release testing procedure.

## Finish Release

Once the debians pass all the required testing, it is ready to become an
official flight release. Please make one pull request on astrobee develop.
Set Brian, Katie, or Marina as the reviewer. They will review the request
and do the merging into develop and master. You will also need to copy the
debians to a temporary location on volar.

    scp astrobee0_0.x.x_armhf.deb \
      <ndc_username>@volar:/home/p-free-flyer/free-flyer/FSW/ars_debs/release_candidate/
    scp astrobee-config_0.x.x_all.deb \
      <ndc_username>@volar:/home/p-free-flyer/free-flyer/FSW/ars_debs/release_candidate/
    scp astrobee-dev_0.x.x_armhf.deb \
      <ndc_username>@volar:/home/p-free-flyer/free-flyer/FSW/ars_debs/release_candidate/

After the debians have been copied to volar, make sure the group permissions are
set to read and right. Finally, please email Ruben Garcia Ruiz so that he can
sign it and stage it.

### Merging into Develop and Master

This section is for reviewers only! After reviewing the pull request and
verifying that the release passed all sections of the release testing procedure,
please merge the pull request into develop. You will then need to merge the
develop branch into master (squash and merge). After this merge, please create
a github release and merge master back into develop (merge commit).
