\page mapper Mapper

The \ref mapper node is responsible for maintaining a representation of the
environment, which is in turn used by the \ref planner node for planning
segments. Internally, the \ref mapper stores a collection of keep-in and
keep-out zones, as well as a map of the environment, which it builds by
incrementally fusing measurements from picoflexx sensor(s). Ultimately, both
representations are reduced by the \ref mapper to a collection of free-space
polygons, in which the \ref planner searches for a suitable path.

Observation: as of now, transformation of a map to free-space polygons is not
yet implemented.

The \ref mapper node can be divided in the following tasks:

* `Octomapper` - Maps Astrobee's surroundings using an octomap (octree-based map);
* `Sentinel` - Checks for imminent collisions and notifies the controller if an
  imminent collision has been detected;

## Octomapper

The Octomapper portion of the \ref mapper creates a 3D occupancy map of the
environment that maps known areas probabilistically. The Octomapper builds a
representation of the environment (clutter topology) using measurements from the
\ref picoflexx depth sensor. Mapping is done in the world frame, and the TF2
library is used to transform from the sensor frame to the world frame based on
dynamic transforms published by the EKF, and static transforms published by \ref
framestore. It is based on the following work:

The Octomap library stores data in an Octree data structure. This implies in
efficient memory allocation, since only known areas are stored in memory. Beyond
that, this library enhances memory allocation efficiency by exploiting tree
pruning methods.

In addition to that, Octomap constantly updates occupancy probabilities for
every voxel (3D pixel) in the tree. Therefore, at every new point cloud
measurement, the occupancy probabilities are updated through a Bayesian update.

Most of the code used in the \ref mapper uses the API provided in the Octomap
library. However, some extra functionality was added:

* `Map inflation (C-expansion)` - This is important for collision checking and path planning.
* `Fading memory` - Since the main goal of the map is to be used for collision
  detection (and possibly local path planning), there is no need to store old
  information in the map. Hence, the \ref mapper has a fading memory method that
  reduces map confidence as time goes by. When a voxel confidence reaches a
  certain threshold, it is deallocated from the map.

The Octomapper subscribes to:

* `point cloud data` - The map is updated based on point cloud data.
* `tf information` - In order to determine the location of the point cloud in
the world frame, the mapper needs to rotate the point cloud data from camera
frame to world frame. This is done by threads that listen to tf updates.

The Octomapper publishes ROS visualization_markers, which can be used for human
visual inspection of the map using RVIZ. It should be mentioned that these
visualization_markers are only published if there is a subscriber to it. Hence,
if nobody requests to see them in RVIZ, it won't be published. The importance of
this is to avoid high-bandwidth information being sent across the network. Map
visualization can be seen through the topics:

* `mapper/obstacle_markers` - Visualization of the occupied voxels in the
non-inflated map.
* `mapper/free_space_markers` - Visualization of the free voxels in the
non-inflated map.
* `mapper/inflated_obstacle_markers` - Visualization of the occupied voxels
in the inflated map.
* `mapper/inflated_free_space_markers` - Visualization of the free voxels in
the inflated map.
* `mapper/frustum_markers` - visualization of the depth sensor frustum. This
is useful for visualizing the sensor's field of view.

The Octomapper takes the following paramers as inputs (defined in mapper.config):

* `use_haz_cam` - Enables/disables the use of the haz_cam for mapping.
* `use_perch_cam` - Enables/disables the use of the perch_cam for mapping.
* `map_resolution (meters)` - Size of a voxel in the Octomap.
* `max_range (meters)` - Maximum reliable range of the depth camera.
* `min_range (meters)` - Minimum reliable range of the depth camera.
* `memory_time (seconds)` - How long the octomap remembers the fading memory
map. It remembers forever when this variable is <= 0.
* `robot_radius (meters)` - Radius of the robot considered in the planner.
* `collision_distance (meters)` - Minimum distance margin to maintain away from obstacles.
* `cam_fov (radians)` - Camera horizontal field-of-view. The octomap will only
update the map in the volume within the fov of the depth cam.
* `cam_aspect_ratio` - Depth camera's width divided by height. Used for c
alculating the camera's frustum.
* `occupancy_threshold` - Probability threshold above which a node is
considered occupied.
* `probability_hit` - Probability that a measured obstacle is an obstacle
(detection probability).
* `probability_miss` - Probability that a measured free area is an obstacle
(false alarm).
* `clamping_threshold_min` - Minimum probability assigned as occupancy for a
  node. This should not be set to 0, because the probability of a free node
  being occupied might asymptotically converge to 0 as more measurements come
  in. If, however, this node becomes occupied sometime in the future, the
  Bayesian update would not trust the sensor anymore.
* `clamping_threshold_max` - Maximum probability assigned as occupancy for a node. This should not be set to 1, due to the considerations above.

Some parameters of the Octomap can be changed during execution by calling the
following services:

* `mapper/update_resolution` - This updates the size of the voxels in the
octomap. When called, this service will erase the whole map.
* `mapper/update_memory_time` - This updates the fading memory time.
* `mapper/update_inflation_radius` - Updates the inflation radius of the map.
When called, this service will erase the whole map.
* `mapper/reset_map` - When called, this service will erase the whole map.

## Sentinel

As its name suggests, the responsibility of the Sentinel is to look out for the
safety of the platform. Unlike the \ref planner, which depends on map-building
to proactively plan a safe path through a representation of the world, the
sentinel node reacts to sensed data to check if the platform is likely to
collide with an obstacle over some fixed time horizon, based on the segment it
is currently following.

![alt text](../images/mobility/sentinel2.png "Collision avoidance")

The sentinel is activated when a new trajectory is published in
`gnc/ctl/segment`. A subscriber gets the message and "voxelizes" the trajectory
as shown in the pipeline below:

![alt text](../images/mobility/trajectory_voxelization.png "Collision avoidance")

* `Original Trajectory` - This is an example of a trajectory planned by Astrobee.
* `Oversampled Curve` - First thing we do in this pipeline is an oversampling
(capture data with high sampling rate)
* `Downsample` - We perform a downsample using the algorithm from the paper
shown below. In essence, we retain the samples such that straight lines between
two samples deviate at most `traj_compression_max_dev` from the original curve.
```

  author={Bulut, Eyuphan and Capin, Tolga},
  booktitle={Computer animation and social agents},
  pages={119},
  year={2007}
}
```
* `Bresenham (Voxelize)` - We use Bresenham's line algorithm to obtain the
voxels between two samples.
* `One-neighbor Expansion` - We perform One-Neighbor Expansion on the previous
set of voxels to obtain a more conservative result.

It is important to mention that the resolution for the voxels in this pipeline
does not need to match the resolution of the Octomap. We can use much smaller
voxels here such that we are conservative enough (after the one-neighbor
expansion), but we are not too conservative when checking these voxels against
the map.

In parallel, a thread checks if the structure containing the voxelized
trajectory is empty. If not, the voxelized trajectory will be compared against
the octomap to search for collision. If a collision is found, the Sentinel
notifies the motion controller by sending a std_msgs::PointStamped message to
`mob/sentinel/collisions`, informing where and when the collision will happen.

Visualization of `oversampled trajectory`, `downsampled trajectory`, and final
`voxelized trajectory` can be seen in Rviz by subscribing to
`mapper/discrete_trajectory_markers`. These markers disappear when a collision
is detected, or when a trajectory is fully executed.

The Sentinel has the following input parameters:

* `traj_compression_max_dev (meters)` - Used in the `Downsampling` step of the
pipeline above. The deviation of the straight lines w.r.t. the original curve
is upper bounded by this parameter.
* `traj_compression_resolution (meters)` - Resolution (voxel size) of the
voxelized trajectory.
