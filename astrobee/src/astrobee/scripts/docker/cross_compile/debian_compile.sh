# This image is split into two, because we need to copy over the toolchain
# folder and rootfs folder. Because docker can only access files in the
# build context, and we don't want it to scan the entire computer by
# chosing a bigger build context, this is the easiest solution. This also
# allows the user to place the folders freely.

# Base docker image copies over the toolchain and rootfs, resulting from
# the NASA_INSTALL.md instructions. Also installs minimum dependencies
set -e

# Check that the paths are defined
