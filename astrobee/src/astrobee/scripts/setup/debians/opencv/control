Package: libopencv-dev3.3.1
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends:
 libopencv3.3.1 (= ${binary:Version}),
 pkg-config,
 ${misc:Depends},
 ${shlibs:Depends},
Description: development files for opencv
 This is a metapackage providing development package necessary for
 development of OpenCV (Open Computer Vision).
 .
 The Open Computer Vision Library is a collection of algorithms and sample
 code for various computer vision problems. The library is compatible with
 IPL (Intel's Image Processing Library) and, if available, can use IPP
 (Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives) for better performance.
 .
 OpenCV provides low level portable data types and operators, and a set
 of high level functionalities for video acquisition, image processing and
 analysis, structural analysis, motion analysis and object tracking, object
 recognition, camera calibration and 3D reconstruction.
