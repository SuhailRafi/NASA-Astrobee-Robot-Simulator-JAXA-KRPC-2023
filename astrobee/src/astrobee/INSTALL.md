## Quick start using the Astrobee Docker image

*The following has been tested on native (non-VM) Ubuntu systems using X11 (the default). Please see [these ROS pages](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials#Tooling_with_Docker) for more resources.*

If you just want to try out the astrobee simulator, you can use one of the Docker images in the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/pkgs/container/astrobee).

Make sure you have Docker installed in your Ubuntu system following the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

For some systems (with discrete graphics cards), you may need to install [additional software](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration).

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/nasa/astrobee.git
cd astrobee
./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote
```

## Building the code natively

There are different ways to build and test the code.

### Non-NASA users

If you are a non-NASA user the preferred supported method is to use Ubuntu 16 and ROS kinetic. Ubuntu 18 and ROS melodic instructions are included, but not officially supported. This method does not require VPN access.

\subpage install-nonNASA


### NASA users

If you are a NASA user and want to install the cross-compiler for robot testing follow these instructions: 

\subpage install-NASA

## Using Docker

Docker builds are available for Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04.

Instructions on how to build the images natively and run the containers are in:
