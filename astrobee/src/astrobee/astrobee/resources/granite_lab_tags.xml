  <!-- Position of the AR targets on the dock

      The position of the marker corners below are
      computed with the script:
      astrobee/config/granite_lab_markers.config

      This is only a temporaty measure, waiting to replace
      the arxmlio.cc with a working arxmlconfig.cc. When
      the new reader will be available, this xml file
      will disapear and the the marker localizaiton will
      directly get its input from the lua config file.

      This version of the position correspond to
      dock_markers.config @ ffe7444ad
      Which generates the target pattern installed on the
      updated dock with berths for P4D.

       Note for previous version (obsolete on 02/01/17):
       These position are computed from a Matlab script
       (new_dock_targets.m). The location of each of the
       9 AR tags are known relative to the dock itself.
       The position of the dock relative to the world
       reference (center of the granite table) needs to
       be measured (and offset added in the matlab script).

  <!--
      Old comments for reference (invalid since we do not measure the
      location of the AR tags):

      This file contains 3D measurements at several locations in the
      granite lab.

      The numbers below refer to the black corners of the AR tag on
      the docking station.  The AR tag was mounted upside down, so
      what is topleft below is physically bottomright as seen from the
      bot camera.

      The AR tag corners were measured with an un-referenced total
      station. The location in the granite table reference frame was
      then computed by using original location of room corners and
      deriving the back transform with a Matlab script.

  <!--
       Measurements for the granite lab room corners. These
       must be kept in sync with what is in
       communications/ff_frame_store/launch/ff_frame_store.launch
       The front of the room is towards the window.
       Face the back of the room, so look towards
       the granite table (the window is at your back).
       The door is on the right.
