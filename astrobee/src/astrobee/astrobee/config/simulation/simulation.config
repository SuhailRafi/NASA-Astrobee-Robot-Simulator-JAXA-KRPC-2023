-- Unless you are on a high performance machine, ie. not in a virtualized
-- environment, with a decent processor and graphics card, enabling any

-- Increasing the camera sample rate incurs a high rendering and serialization
-- cost. Setting the rate to zero effectively disables the camera. By default
-- we only enable the haz_cam, because it's needed for obstacle detection.
