"""
Filter rosbag messages based on topic. Like a subset of 'rosbag filter' functionality,
but more robust to malformed bags because it doesn't need to parse the messages
to filter on topic.

Topic filtering is controlled by an accept list and a reject list, as follows:
- By default, all messages are accepted.
- However, if the accept list is non-empty, only topics that match one of the patterns
  in the accept list are accepted.
- If the reject list is non-empty, topics that match one of the reject patterns will be
  rejected, even if they match an accept pattern.

The patterns in the accept and reject list can be simple strings, or you can use
Python fnmatch Unix shell-style wildcards, like "/gs/*" to match any topic that starts
with "/gs/". Note that the "/" character is not treated as special in this context.
Remember to quote patterns that include wildcards so they are not expanded by your shell.

Specify multiple --accept or --reject arguments on the command line to add multiple
patterns to the accept or reject list.

Examples:
  rosbag_topic_filter.py in.bag -r "/gs/*" -r /hw/cam_sci/compressed out.bag
    Filters out rosjava messages produced by Guest Science and SciCamImage APKs
    that have incomplete message definitions that break many rosbag API operations,
    including the command-line utilities 'rosbag filter' and 'rosbag check'.
  rosbag_topic_filter.py in.bag -a /mgt/sys_monitor/time_sync out.bag
    Keep only a specific message of interest for data analysis so downstream script
    can run much faster on a smaller bag.
